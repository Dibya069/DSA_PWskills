    "- Compiler: A compiler is a software program that translates the entire source code of a program into machine code or bytecode before execution. It scans the entire source code, performs various optimizations, and generates an executable file or bytecode that can be directly executed by the target system without further translation. Examples of compiled languages include C, C++, and Java (although Java uses a hybrid approach with bytecode compilation and interpretation).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interpreter: An interpreter, on the other hand, translates and executes the source code line by line, without prior compilation. It reads one line or a small section of the source code, converts it into an intermediate representation, and immediately executes it. This process is repeated for each line of code. Interpreted languages often have a shorter development cycle as changes to the source code can be quickly tested without the need for a separate compilation step. Examples of interpreted languages include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby."
